#MoviePilot

Based on the partial code redesign of [NAStool](https://github.com/NAStool/nas-tools) , it focuses on the core requirements of automation, reducing problems and making it easier to expand and maintain.

#Only for learning and communication, please do not promote this project on any domestic platform!

Release channel: https://t.me/moviepilot_channel

## Main features
-Separation of front-end and back-end, based on FastApi + Vue3 , front-end project address: [MoviePilot-Frontend](https://github.com/jxxghp/MoviePilot-Frontend)
-Focus on core needs, simplify functions and settings, and use default values for some settings.
-The user interface has been redesigned to be more beautiful and easier to use .

## Installation

### 1. ** Install CookieCloud plug-in **

Site information needs to be obtained through CookieCloud synchronization , so you need to install the CookieCloud plug-in to synchronize the site cookie data in the browser to the cloud and then synchronize it to MoviePilot for use. Please click [ here ](https://github.com/easychen/CookieCloud/releases) for the plug-in download address .

### 2. ** Install CookieCloud server (optional) **

MoviePilot has a built-in public CookieCloud server . If you need to build your own service, you can refer to the [CookieCloud](https://github.com/easychen/CookieCloud) project to build it. For the docker image, please click [ here ](https://hub .docker.com/r/easychen/cookiecloud) .

** Statement: ** This project will not collect sensitive user data. Cookie synchronization is also based on the CookieCloud project and is not a capability provided by this project. From a technical perspective , CookieCloud uses end-to-end encryption. A third party cannot steal any user information (including the server holder ) without revealing the ` user KEY` and ` end-to-end encrypted password` . If you are worried, you donâ€™t have to use public services or this project. However, if any information leakage occurs after use, this project has nothing to do with it!

### 3. ** Install supporting management software **

MoviePilot requires a downloader and media server to be used together.
-Downloader supports : qBittorrent , Transmission , QB version number requirement >= 4.3.9 , TR version number requirement >= 3.0 , QB is recommended .
-Media server support: Jellyfin , Emby , Plex , Emby is recommended .

### 4. ** Install MoviePilot**

## Configuration

All configurations of the project are set through environment variables, and two configuration methods are supported:
- Configure parameters in the Docker environment variables section or Wdinows system environment variables. If the configuration items are not automatically displayed, you need to manually add the corresponding environment variables.
-Download the [app.env](https://github.com/jxxghp/MoviePilot/raw/main/config/app.env) configuration file, modify the configuration and place it in the root directory of the configuration file mapping path , configuration items You can increase or decrease it according to the instructions.

Configuration file mapping path: `/config` , configuration item effective priority: environment variables > env file > default value, ** Some parameters such as path mapping, site authentication, permission port, time zone, etc. must be configured through environment variables ** .

items marked with $\color{red}{*}$ are required, and the others are optional. If you choose the option, you can delete the configuration variable and use the default value.

that do not comply with all levels of filtering rules will not be selected


## Use

- Quickly synchronize sites through CookieCloud synchronization. Sites that are not needed can be disabled in the WEB management interface, and sites that cannot be synchronized can be added manually .
-Manage through WEB, add WEB to the mobile desktop to obtain App- like usage effects, management interface port: ` 3000` , background API port: `3001` .
-Achieve automatic sorting and scraping through downloader monitoring or directory monitoring plug-in (choose one of the two).
-Remote management through WeChat /Telegram/Slack/SynologyChat , where WeChat /Telegram will automatically add an operation menu (the number of WeChat menus is limited, and some menus are not displayed); WeChat needs to set the callback address on the official page, and SynologyChat needs to set it The robot passes in the address, and the relative path of the address is: `/api/v1/message/` .
-Set media server Webhook , send playback notifications through MoviePilot , etc. The relative path of Webhook callback is `/api/v1/webhook?token=moviepilot` ( `3001` port), where `moviepilot` is the set `API_TOKEN` .
- Add MoviePilot as a Radarr or Sonarr server to Overseerr or Jellyseerr ( `API service port` ) , and you can use Overseerr/Jellyseerr to browse subscriptions.
- Map the host docker.sock file to the container `/var/run/docker.sock` to support built-in restart operations. Example: `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro`

### ** NOTE **
-The first startup of the container requires downloading the browser kernel, which may take a long time depending on network conditions, and you cannot log in at this time. The `/moviepilot` directory can be mapped to avoid re-triggering the browser kernel download after the container is reset. 
-When using a reverse proxy , you need to add the following configuration, otherwise some functions may be inaccessible ( `ip:port` is modified to the actual value):
```nginx configuration
location/{
proxy_pass http://ip:port;
proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```
-The newly created enterprise WeChat application requires a proxy with a fixed public IP to receive messages. Add the following code to the proxy:
```nginx configuration
location /cgi-bin/gettoken {
proxy_pass https://qyapi.weixin.qq.com;
}
location /cgi-bin/message/send {
proxy_pass https://qyapi.weixin.qq.com;
}
location /cgi-bin/menu/create {
proxy_pass https://qyapi.weixin.qq.com;
}
```
